At one point in the conversation, he describes a specific set of physical needs he checks before allowing himself to ruminate, particularly when he is struggling with feelings of meaninglessness or hopelessness, which he links to his ADHD-related depression.\nTrevor said he has learned \u0026ldquo;rules now for myself and for anyone out there\u0026rdquo; to address these feelings. When he finds himself struggling or about to think intensely about things, he asks himself a few simple questions:\nHave you slept? Have you eaten well (good food)? Have you moved your body? Have you spent a little time breathing? Trevor explains that if the answer to any of these questions is no, he first focuses on fulfilling these basic needs. He emphasizes that he is often shocked how often times you aren\u0026rsquo;t still feeling the same way on the other side after addressing these physical needs.\nHe discovered this method as a coping mechanism for his ADHD, which can cause him to get \u0026ldquo;stuck in a loop\u0026rdquo; or hyperfocus on negative thoughts, making life seem meaningless. By focusing on these fundamental physical states, he can get his brain \u0026ldquo;out of that loop\u0026rdquo; and shift his perspective, allowing him to be more present and find meaning in small, immediate experiences. He contrasts this with men\u0026rsquo;s common coping mechanisms of drinking, masturbating, gambling, or resorting to anger rather than expressing hurt or sadness.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve implemented this technique in my own life and have found it to be tremendously helpful. It has been astounding how many times I was in a bad headspace or caught in a negative thought loop, only to break out of it by taking a few minutes to breath or move my body.\n[!info] Source: Trevor Noah - The Diary of A CEO Podcast\n","date":"31 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/check-your-physical-needs/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Check your physical needs when you're mentally spiraling","type":"posts"},{"content":"Have you ever performed a git rebase and realized you made a huge mistake? Have you even deleted a branch by mistake? If none of your changes have been pushed to a remote repo, this could mean you\u0026rsquo;ve lost a tremendous amount of work.\nLuckily, you can recover from those situations using the git reflog.\n[!info] git-reflog\nThis command manages the information recorded in the reflogs.\nReference logs, or \u0026ldquo;reflogs\u0026rdquo;, record when the tips of branches and other references were updated in the local repository. Reflogs are useful in various Git commands, to specify the old value of a reference. For example, HEAD@{2} means \u0026ldquo;where HEAD used to be two moves ago\u0026rdquo;, master@{one.week.ago} means \u0026ldquo;where master used to point to one week ago in this local repository\u0026rdquo;, and so on. See gitrevisions[7] for more details.\nsource: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reflog\nJust like with git log, reflog has a SHA for each entry. These SHA\u0026rsquo;s can be used just like the commit SHA\u0026rsquo;s in your log. You can use commands like checkout or reset with the SHA\u0026rsquo;s from reflog to interact with your repository at essentially any point in your recent history. So if you want to undo that rebase operation you just performed, you can use reflog to find a point in time before the rebase and use reset --hard to undo the rebase. You could also create a branch based on that state of your repository. The former would look like this:\ngit checkout VMP-380 Switched to branch \u0026#39;VMP-380\u0026#39; Your branch is up to date with \u0026#39;origin/VMP-380\u0026#39;. git log --oneline -n10 817adf9 (HEAD -\u0026gt; VMP-380, origin/VMP-380) VMP-380: Adding prod processing select privs to SA_DEV_LOADER 0b05d80 VMP-374: Exclude duplicate DC identifiers from ferring extract views (#103) 5c355de VMP-370: Add tp abbreviation to medlines mapping script (#102) 37b0f1d VMP-368: Add maintenance bin indicators to processing_867_validation_alert (#101) a543448 VMP-367: Fix inflating line count bug in edi file summary views (#100) 1654dc1 VMP-365: Add supporting tables for ReprocessingRequests (#99) 56f439d VMP-360: Add trading_partner_file_expectations migration script (#95) 148358f VMP-362: clear maintenance bin flags from N101 SU 852 lines (#98) dc30e73 VMP-363: 867 Forecast Example (#96) 700a7d7 VMP-364: Bulk Product Identifiers Insert (#97) git rebase origin/main Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/VMP-380. git log --oneline -n10 3f216c6 (HEAD -\u0026gt; VMP-380) VMP-380: Adding prod processing select privs to SA_DEV_LOADER 21bd78c (origin/main, origin/HEAD, main) VMP-382: Add Pelthos 852 ZA code mappings (part 1) (#105) b068156 VMP-414: Add v_pelthos_launch view (#111) 15148ad VMP-406: Create WEB_DATA_CONNECTIONS table (#110) 1a186e6 VMP-394: Change LOG_ENTRIES ID from int to guid (#109) b22965e VMP-398: Ensure blocked locations appear in consolidated sales view (#108) ee11334 VMP-392: Add edi_997_recipient_configs table (#107) 457060c VMP-385: adjust backout_8XX_file sprocs to delete from stg_* tables (#106) 4f02b4b VMP-381: Added load time to invalid identifiers (#104) 0b05d80 VMP-374: Exclude duplicate DC identifiers from ferring extract views (#103) git reflog -n10 3f216c6 (HEAD -\u0026gt; VMP-380) HEAD@{0}: rebase (finish): returning to refs/heads/VMP-380 3f216c6 (HEAD -\u0026gt; VMP-380) HEAD@{1}: rebase (pick): VMP-380: Adding prod processing select privs to SA_DEV_LOADER 21bd78c (origin/main, origin/HEAD, main) HEAD@{2}: rebase (start): checkout origin/main 817adf9 (origin/VMP-380) HEAD@{3}: checkout: moving from main to VMP-380 21bd78c (origin/main, origin/HEAD, main) HEAD@{4}: pull: Fast-forward 15148ad HEAD@{5}: checkout: moving from VMP-414 to main 6e2041f HEAD@{6}: commit: VMP-414: Filter on partner abbreviation instead of name 93bfb0b HEAD@{7}: checkout: moving from main to VMP-414 15148ad HEAD@{8}: checkout: moving from VMP-414 to main 93bfb0b HEAD@{9}: commit: VMP-414: Expand log_entries value columns to be max varchar git reset --hard 817adf9 HEAD is now at 817adf9 VMP-380: Adding prod processing select privs to SA_DEV_LOADER git log --oneline -n10 817adf9 (HEAD -\u0026gt; VMP-380, origin/VMP-380) VMP-380: Adding prod processing select privs to SA_DEV_LOADER 0b05d80 VMP-374: Exclude duplicate DC identifiers from ferring extract views (#103) 5c355de VMP-370: Add tp abbreviation to medline mapping script (#102) 37b0f1d VMP-368: Add maintenance bin indicators to processing_867_validation_alert (#101) a543448 VMP-367: Fix inflating line count bug in edi file summary views (#100) 1654dc1 VMP-365: Add supporting tables for ReprocessingRequests (#99) 56f439d VMP-360: Add trading_partner_file_expectations migration script (#95) 148358f VMP-362: clear maintenance bin flags from N101 SU 852 lines (#98) dc30e73 VMP-363: 867 Forecast Example (#96) 700a7d7 VMP-364: Bulk Product Identifiers Insert (#97) In the snippet above we:\nchecked out the VMP-380 branch rebased it with origin/main used reflog to identify the SHA before the rebase reset our local branch to the point immediately before the rebase observe that the history of our branch is ended an identical state to when we initially checked out VMP-380 Hope this saves you some grief in the future.

Your job duties will change, so you won’t be expected to leverage them. Instead, you’ll be expected to perform a new set of job duties that require an entirely new skillset.\nThat’s not to say that the skills you’ve acquired are useless. In my experience, you will use your old skills in two ways, especially if you’ve previously held the role of those you’re managing:\nYou’ll be in a good position to ask your team the right questions. Since you’ve done their jobs before, you generally know what it takes to get the job done and may have run into the same problems your team is facing. When you need to make a decision quickly, your team is more likely to accept your decision on the spot because they know you have experience performing their jobs. Management is a set of behaviors that can be learned #\rBehaviors are the things you say and do. Management requires the execution of a set of simple behaviors every day. I’ll emphasize that these behaviors aren’t easy. They are just simple to describe and understand. I believe some of the most important behaviors are:\nSetting clear expectations Providing feedback Delegation Evaluating performance No one is likely to teach you these behaviors before taking on a management role. You have experienced these behaviors under a good leader if you\u0026rsquo;re fortunate. Regardless, you can learn these things even if you have to seek out books, podcasts, or other online resources. I found the Manager Tools podcast a tremendously helpful place to start since all of the advice contains at least one actionable component.\nManagers don’t have as much decision making power as you might think #\rA middle manager still has a boss. They are a cog in the machine just like you, just a different kind of cog. They can’t unilaterally make sweeping changes to the organization. Are they potentially better positioned to raise concerns or suggest changes to processes? Probably. But they still can’t implement change on their own, necessarily. There may be company-wide standards they might need to work with. There may be budget constraints that prevent them from implementing a good idea right now. Your manager likely sees the same problems in the organization that you do. If they aren’t doing something about it, there might be a good reason that you simply don’t have visibility to.\nYou will need to implement decisions you disagree with #\rHand-in-hand with the fact that managers don’t have as much power as you might think. They may also have to implement decisions they don’t personally agree with. Some might call this “carrying the company’s water”. The folks at Manager Tools would call this “professional subordination”. Once a decision is made, the manager must execute the will of the company (excluding ethical concerns, of course).\nAs a (middle) manager, you might have a seat at the table when the options affecting your team are discussed. But, once a decision is made, any other ideas that were in consideration are moot. It will be your responsibility to implement the chosen idea in good faith.\nBe prepared to become an air traffic controller #\rMost of my job duties involved “deep work” as a software developer. It\u0026rsquo;s a term coined by Cal Newport, a computer science professor at Georgetown University and author of the “Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World”. According to Newport, “Deep work refers to a professional activity performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that pushes your cognitive capabilities to their limit”.\nAs a manager of software development teams, I’ve found I engage in almost no deep work anymore. Instead, I find myself playing the role of an air traffic controller, constantly switching gears and changing my focus. I always need to be ready to make a decision, reprioritize my team’s work, coach my team through a challenging situation or problem, etc.\nBut that’s ok. It’s what the job requires. By being responsive, I’m making sure others aren’t stuck in a state of limbo while they wait for a decision. As an individual contributor, I was expected to keep my head down and focus on a single problem for hours. As a manager, I was expected to always have my ears open and to keep myself as available as possible. This paradigm shift can be quite jarring if you aren’t ready for it.\nYou will get praise and blame for things you didn’t do yourself #\rBeing a manager means being responsible for the performance of others. When your team does well, others outside your team may compliment you. A good leader recognizes that they are just a proxy for the team and in that instance will redirect that praise to the team. On the other hand, when the team does poorly, others outside your team may blame and criticize you. In these instances, I think good leaders take responsibility and commit to working with their team to perform better next time.\nIt can feel strange or unfair to get feedback about things you didn’t do personally. You’ll have to get used to this.\nHiring is challenging #\rCan you judge what someone will truly be like to work with before you’ve worked with them? That’s exactly what’s expected of a hiring manager. To decide whether to take the chance on someone and offer them a place on their team. Not only will you want to assess their ability to perform the job duties you need, but you will want to get a sense of what kind of teammate they would be.\nInterviewing well is something that will take practice. Over time you can get better and your rate of successful hires will improve. Just be prepared to live with a level of uncertainty and try to involve several people in the interview process to help you make more informed decisions.\nConclusion #\rIf you\u0026rsquo;re someone looking to get into management for the first time, I hope this has given you some additional perspective or at least some things to consider. I know I always find it easier to handle a situation if I already have some idea of what I\u0026rsquo;m in for.\n","date":"1 May 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/what-i-wish-i-knew-about-management-beforehand/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"What I Wish I Knew About Management Beforehand","type":"posts"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
