When Trevor Noah appeared on the Diary of a CEO podcast, he discussed his mental health journey in detail.  At one point in the conversation, he describes a specific set of physical needs he checks before allowing himself to ruminate, particularly when he is struggling with feelings of meaninglessness or hopelessness, which he links to his ADHD-related depression.

Trevor said he has learned "rules now for myself and for anyone out there" to address these feelings. When he finds himself struggling or about to think intensely about things, he asks himself a few simple questions:

- Have you slept?
- Have you eaten well (good food)?
- Have you moved your body?
- Have you spent a little time breathing?

Trevor explains that if the answer to any of these questions is no, he first focuses on fulfilling these basic needs. He emphasizes that he is often shocked how often times you aren't still feeling the same way on the other side after addressing these physical needs.

He discovered this method as a coping mechanism for his ADHD, which can cause him to get "stuck in a loop" or hyperfocus on negative thoughts, making life seem meaningless. By focusing on these fundamental physical states, he can get his brain "out of that loop" and shift his perspective, allowing him to be more present and find meaning in small, immediate experiences. He contrasts this with men's common coping mechanisms of drinking, masturbating, gambling, or resorting to anger rather than expressing hurt or sadness.

I've implemented this technique in my own life and have found it to be tremendously helpful.  It has been astounding how many times I was in a bad headspace or caught in a negative thought loop, only to break out of it by taking a few minutes to breath or move my body.
